# Orion Programming Language 

The Orion Programming language is an open source client side scripting language, that translates in to Javascript.  
Our Goal is to develop a language that is more understandable and user friendly to the average person. We belive that 
programming should not only be limited to few, but should be used by the whole world. And making programming simpler is 
a great step towards the spread of computer science.
